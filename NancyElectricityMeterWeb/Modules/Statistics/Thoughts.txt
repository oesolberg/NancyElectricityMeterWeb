Statistics

Should be able to have 
* per hour
* per day
* per week
* per month
* per year?

Database stuff
One table for each type?


id, typeOfTimeUnit, datetime start, week/day/month/year number?,number, datecreated

typeOfTimeUnit=hour, day, week, month

Create a service for doing this as scheduled intervalls (create the neccesary stats since it will be timeconsuming to do it on the fly)
